# No automated tests are defined yet.
#
# Reason:
# - This project currently focuses on API + ML inference
# - ML integration will be tested via API requests (Postman / curl)
#
# Unit tests can be added later if:
# - Authentication is introduced
# - Request validation becomes complex
# - Prediction logging is stored in DB
